<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>The Project Athena Zephyr system uses fixed UDP port numbers for
communications between servers, host managers, and clients.  As a
result, it is impossible to run more than one zephyr host manager
(<tt>zhm</tt>) on a single machine.  With the advent of Project
Numenor, users wanted to be able to be able to communicate with both
the Athena and Numenor zephyr servers simultaneously.  This was
impossible without logging in to multiple machines.  Now, the Zephyr
multi-realm host manager (<tt>zmhm</tt>) allows you to run multiple
host managers on the same machine, by modifying the port numbers and
servers used by <tt>zhm</tt>, and forwarding packets appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Currently <tt>zmhm</tt> is only available as a Debian package.  You
can obtain it by adding the line</p>

<pre><b>deb http://numenor.mit.edu/apt stable numenor</b>
</pre>

<p>to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>, then running <tt><b>apt-get
update; apt-get install zmhm</b></tt>.  Alternatively, you can
download the latest version as of this writing directly from here:
<tt><a
href="http://numenor.mit.edu/apt/dists/sarge/numenor/binary-i386/zmhm_0.1.4_i386.deb">zmhm_0.1.4_i386.deb</a></tt>.
For non-<tt>i386</tt> architectures, try the source package: <tt><a
href="http://numenor.mit.edu/apt/dists/sarge/numenor/source/zmhm_0.1.4.tar.gz">zmhm_0.1.4.tar.gz</a></tt>.
You can try installing manually from that tarball on non-Debian
machines, too.</p>

<p>During the installation procedure, you will be asked for the zephyr
servers you wish to use.  List them, separated by spaces, with the
zephyr server you want to use by default first.  If not installing via
the Debian package, create a file <tt><a
href="zmhm.conf">/etc/zmhm.conf</a></tt> with one server on each line,
default server first.  For example, if you wanted to use the Numenor
zephyr server by default but also have the Athena server available,
your file would look like this:</p>

<pre><b>numenor.mit.edu
z1.mit.edu</b>
</pre>

<p>Start <tt>zmhm</tt> by running <tt><b>/etc/init.d/zmhm start</b></tt>,
if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>When <tt>zmhm</tt> is installed, your zephyr clients
(<tt>zwgc</tt>, <tt>zwrite</tt>, or <tt>owl</tt>) are controlled by
the environment variable <tt>ZEPHYR_SERVER</tt>.  Thus if you want to
send a zephyr to user <tt>rwbarton</tt> on the Athena zephyr server,
you might do it like this:</p>

<pre>$ <b>ZEPHYR_SERVER=z1.mit.edu zwrite rwbarton</b>
zwrite: Don't have Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (get_ad_tkt) while sending notice to rwbarton
$ <i># Oops, we don't have Athena tickets right now so can't send authentic zephyrs</i>
$ <b>ZEPHYR_SERVER=z1.mit.edu zwrite -d rwbarton</b>
Type your message now.  End with control-D or a dot on a line by itself.
<b>Hi, Reid!</b>
<b>.</b>
Message queued for rwbarton... sent
</pre>

<p>Here you used the <tt>-d</tt> flag to send an unauthentic zephyr,
because your ticket file probably has your Numenor tickets, not your
Athena tickets.  (If your machine is primarily set up for Athena
access, reverse the roles of Numenor and Athena in this example.)  On
the Numenor system, there is a handy script <tt>athena</tt> that sets
other environment variables like <tt>KRBTKFILE</tt> to help
<tt>zwrite</tt> find your Athena tickets.  It also sets
<tt>ZEPHYR_SERVER</tt> to <tt>z1.mit.edu</tt>, so you can do the
following:</p>

<pre>$ <b>athena kinit -54</b>
Password for <i>username</i>@ATHENA.MIT.EDU: <b>********</b>
$ <b>athena zwrite rwbarton</b>
Type your message now.  End with control-D or a dot on a line by itself.
<b>I can send authentic zephyrs now.</b>
<b>.</b>
Message queued for rwbarton... sent
</pre>

<p>As for receiving zephyrs, you should be able to run two
<tt>zwgc</tt> processes as follows, although this has not been tested:</p>

<pre>$ <b>zwgc -ttymode -subfile ~/.zephyr.subs.numenor</b>
$ <b>rm /tmp/wg.$UID</b>
$ <b>athena zwgc -ttymode -subfile ~/.zephyr.subs.athena</b>
</pre>

<p>If you prefer the <tt>owl</tt> zephyr client, there isn't any run
file that needs to be deleted, but unfortunately <tt>owl</tt> has no
analogue of <tt>zwgc</tt>'s <tt>-subfile</tt> option.  A workaround is
to add subscription commands for Athena to <tt>~/.owlconf.athena</tt>,
then invoke <tt>owl</tt> as <tt><b>owl -n -c
~/.owlconf.athena</b></tt>.  (The <tt>-n</tt> option prevents
<tt>owl</tt> from loading subscriptions from
<tt>~/.zephyr.subs</tt>.)</p>

<p>The same procedure of setting <tt>ZEPHYR_SERVER</tt> should work
with all zephyr clients ([<tt>x</tt>]<tt>zwrite</tt>, <tt>zaway</tt>,
<tt>zleave</tt>, <tt>zlocate</tt>, <tt>znol</tt>) except
<tt>zaway</tt> and possibly <tt>zctl</tt>; see <a
href="#lim-zstat">below</a>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can only configure <tt>zmhm</tt> to use one zephyr server per
realm, so you must choose between <tt>z1.mit.edu</tt>,
<tt>z2.mit.edu</tt>, and <tt>z3.mit.edu</tt>.  You could list them as
separate servers in <tt>/etc/zmhm.conf</tt>, but you would have to
specify which one you want every time you run a zephyr client; you
can't get <tt>zhm</tt>'s behavior of switching to a new zephyr server
transparently if the current one is down.</li>

<li id="lim-zstat">A couple zephyr clients like <tt>zstat</tt> and the
<tt>hm_flush</tt> operation of <tt>zctl</tt> contact the zephyr server
directly, rather than through the host manager.  These clients need
special treatment to work under <tt>zmhm</tt>.  A wrapper for
<tt>zstat</tt> is included with the <tt>zmhm</tt> distribution; it
behaves correctly according to the value of <tt>ZEPHYR_SERVER</tt>,
but does not support any of <tt>zstat</tt>'s command-line options.
The <tt>zctl hm_flush</tt> command is currently unsupported.</li>

<li>The <tt>wg_*</tt> commands of <tt>zctl</tt> presumably use
<tt>/tmp/wg.$UID</tt> to find <tt>zwgc</tt>.  If you use the method
above to run two <tt>zwgc</tt> processes, you won't be able to talk to
both of them.  This isn't a big deal, because the <tt>wg_*</tt>
operations aren't very useful.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation Details</h2>

<p>To be written...</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li><tt>zmhm</tt> acts oddly when <tt>/etc/zmhm.conf</tt> doesn't have
any servers listed.  Workaround: Don't do that.</li>

<li><tt>zstat</tt> doesn't query <tt>zmhm</tt> for the default server;
instead it reads the top line of <tt>/etc/zmhm.conf</tt>.  Unlikely to
cause problems.</li>

<li>When <tt>zmhm</tt> is running on the same machine as
<tt>zephyrd</tt> the Zephyr server will get confused.  Add
<tt><b>export ZMHM_DISABLE=1</b></tt> to your
<tt>/etc/init.d/zephyrd</tt> if this affects you.
</li>
</ul>
