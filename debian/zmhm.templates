Description: What are your zephyr servers?
 Please enter the zephyr servers you wish to use,
 separated by spaces.  You can only enter one zephyr
 server per realm, so you must choose between z1.mit.edu,
 z2.mit.edu, and z3.mit.edu, for example.  The first server
 in the list will be used as the default.
